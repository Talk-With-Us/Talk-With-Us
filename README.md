## Installation 🛠️

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.   Clone the repository:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/samaypusarla/Talk-With-Us.git

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo

3.  Install dependencies using PNPM, a fast package manager:

    ```bash
    pnpm install

4.  Set your [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) API key as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    ```

    Replace `"sk-..."` with your actual OpenAI API key.

5.  Start the development server:

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev

6.  Your application should now be running locally. You can access it in your web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

This code assumes that you're using PNPM as your package manager; if you're using NPM or Yarn, you can replace `pnpm` with `npm` or `yarn` as needed.
